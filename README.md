Octaverse $

Octaverse is a collection of self-contained scientific and computational projects, each tackling a distinct topic or domain within physics, computing, and related fields.

This repository is designed as an evolving knowledge base and portfolio—new topics and hands-on code will be added as I explore new subjects.

Structure :

Each topic or project lives in its own subfolder—complete with its own README, code, and resources.

Projects can span simulations, visualizations, data analysis, and hands-on demonstrations of modern scientific tools.

Current Topics-

Sub Atomic :

Quantum computing and quantum simulation playground.

Includes Qiskit-based code to build, visualize, and experiment with multi-qubit entangled states and introduce "defects" to simulate real-world quantum systems or materials.

How to Use This Repo :

Browse each topic folder for dedicated instructions, sample code, and explanations.

Each topic folder contains a README with step-by-step setup and interpretation of results.

Roadmap :

Over time, I aim for Octaverse to cover a broad range of subjects, each with a practical, code-driven approach—demonstrating not just theory, but hands-on experimental learning in Python and other scientific computing tools.

Contributions and suggestions for new topics are welcome as the collection grows.
