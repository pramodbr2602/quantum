Quantum

Quantum is a collection of self-contained scientific and computational projects, each tackling a distinct topic or domain within physics, computing, and related fields.

This repository is designed as an evolving knowledge base and portfolio—new topics and hands-on code will be added as I explore new subjects.

Structure :

Each topic or project lives in its own subfolder—complete with its own README, code, and resources.

Projects can span simulations, visualizations, data analysis, and hands-on demonstrations of modern scientific tools.

Current Topics-

Quantum computing and quantum simulation playground.

Includes Qiskit-based code to build, visualize, and experiment with multi-qubit entangled states and introduce "defects" to simulate real-world quantum systems or materials.

How to Use This Repo :

Browse each topic  dedicated instructions, sample code, and explanations.

Roadmap :

Over time, I aim for Quantum to cover a broad range of subjects, each with a practical, code-driven approach—demonstrating not just theory, but hands-on experimental learning in Python and other scientific computing tools.

Contributions and suggestions for new topics are welcome as the collection grows.
The above last commit was reagardinng the 4-Qubit identifying defects while it is trained with machine learning with qiskit module of quantum environment and in the ouput we got clear output of defects caused and analzyed with histograms .
